# Miteprod React/NextJS Site

I decided to give in and learn a js framework, and react is one of the most popular ones.  
NextJS seems like a pretty good react framework, and I am hosting a lot of my projects with Vercel, so it is a natural fit.  
I also decided to remake the Mite Productions website as jekyll is very basic and more for blogs.  
First real NextJS/React project too!
