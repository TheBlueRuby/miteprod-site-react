                In Ultramite universe basically Earth is canon but not the main
                planet
                <br />
                and Mites are like robots
                <br />
                and on another planet
                <br />
                and so one of the Mites trying to join Mite R&amp;D built a
                robot for his entry project which would become Ultramite 1.0 and
                the Mite got accepted and then later they made Ultramite 2.0
                which was less scuffed to protect Mitopia (i wasn&#39;t that
                inventive with the name of the city)
                <br />
                and then they realised there was nothing to protect mitopia from
                <br />
                because the only non-junkyard part of the planet was Mitopia
                itself
                <br />
                and so then at some point an evil mite called Etim appeared
                (again, not that creative)
                <br />
                then Etim used a computer virus to infect the mites in Mitopia
                <br />
                because they are robots
                <br />
                then the first Ultramite 3.0 is built (the current Ultramite
                model)
                <br />
                its id is Blue8
                <br />
                and so Blue8 goes to the wasteland to stop Etim
                <br />
                and a Mite joins Blue8
                <br />
                and they go to the wasteland
                <br />
                and then failed projects start to awaken thanks to the virus
                <br />
                then they attack Ultramite
                <br />
                so Ultramite has to attack them
                <br />
                and from the floor Ultramite grabs a plasma cannon
                <br />

                />
                <br />
                and Ultramite has to metroid-style find Etim&#39;s lair
                <br />
                which is an old server room
                <br />
                and destroy the virus&#39; organic base
                <br />
                then the virus making program will stop
                <br />
                then because Ultramite has no orders to attack Etim Blue8 must
                leave{" "}
