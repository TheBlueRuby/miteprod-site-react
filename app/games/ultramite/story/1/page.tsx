                The first Ultramite 3.0 prototype booted up.

                <br /> <br />
                The screen on the robot&#8217;s head turned on a bright blue,
                then a face appeared. In a robotic-sounding voice, it started
                initialising services.

                Its voice started to sound more natural, and it began moving
                around to test its systems. Once all boot checks completed, the
                memory of a previous Ultramite model got transferred to it,
                effectively giving it a new body. “Woah, this feels awesome, I
                got an upgrade!”. A researcher for Mite R&amp;D walked into the
                room, happy that the first Ultramite 3.0 worked properly. “It
                seems you have booted up properly, now for the mission.”
            </p>
            <p>“What mission? I wasn&#8217;t told about anything?”</p>
            <p>
                “It was in that contract you signed to get an upgrade,
                didn&#8217;t you read it?”
            </p>
            <p>“Well, if I signed it, then I guess I have to do it then.”</p>
            <p>
                “We designed the 3.0 body to complete this, and you are using
                the only one we have.”
            </p>
            <p>“Ok, but what is the mission?”</p>
            <p>
                Another mite walked into the room. “You have to go through the
                wastelands and destroy the source of whatever virus is being
                sent around Mitopia, then return as soon as possible.”
            </p>
            <p>“Sounds simple!”</p>
            <p>
                The researcher who walked in then asked to speak to Ultramite.
                “Hey, take me along with you! I want to collect some data and
                have always wanted an adventure!”. Both the Ultramite and the
                first researcher agreed, on one condition. “You must do your
                best not to get hurt, but you can go.”
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                As the Ultramite walked out of Mitopia&#8217;s protective
                barrier, it noticed a bunch of destroyed and rusted shells that
                looked like very early robots, including one that looked like a
                cone with a plasma cannon on its side. They had received the
                coordinates of the location of the place they were looking for
                and began heading there. As they trekked the long [[ERROR:
                MEASUREMENT FORMAT UNSUPPORTED]] distance, a purple glow emitted
                from the ground around them. The researcher remarked that it
                reminded him of the pictures of the virus they had gathered, but
                didn&#8217;t think much of it as they were still [[ERROR:
                MEASUREMENT FORMAT UNSUPPORTED]] away from the target.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                Suddenly, more of the same model as the plasma-cannon-wielding
                robot they spotted earlier began to rise from the ground, with
                targeting lasers aimed right at Ultramite&#8217;s head.
                Ultramite noticed it and the researcher were defenceless, as the
                plasma cannon Ultramite had in its 2.0 body wasn&#8217;t carried
                over. Ultramite told the researcher to get down and noticed a
                large piece of metal on the ground that was surprisingly strong
                for its weight. The scanners in Ultramite&#8217;s arm
                couldn&#8217;t tell what it was, and the researcher had no idea
                either. A loud beep emanated from all the robots, and with
                nothing else to use, tried to use the metal piece to deflect the
                plasma shots, and it surprisingly worked. The robots were downed
                and stopped glowing purple. They found a good-quality plasma
                cannon on one of the defunct robots and mounted it on
                Ultramite&#8217;s arm in case of any further attacks.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                A few steps away from their target, Ultramite fell into a
                massive hole, which was dark, but had a faint purple glow like
                the robots did. Ultramite had noticed a being that looked like a
                Mite next to the source of the glow, a pulsating purple blob
                connected to a computer. The Mite looked almost corrupted by it,
                glowing slightly purple itself instead of the usual teal.
                Ultramite noticed that the computer was at the coordinates sent
                to them and knew that was their target. The Mite introduced
                itself as Etim and started to give a long pre-fight monologue.
                Ultramite was getting bored, and it wasn&#8217;t in its briefing
                to attack an enemy, so Ultramite destroyed the blob with a blast
                from the plasma cannon and a second destroyed the computer
                instantly. Etim, surprised that a protagonist would ignore its
                monologue, decided to run and hide, and Ultramite blasted
                through the ceiling and used the recoil from the cannon to blast
                itself out back to Mitopia.{" "}
