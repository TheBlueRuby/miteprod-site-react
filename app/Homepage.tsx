            <p>
                Mite Productions is a small game development group based out of
                Australia. We aim to make fun games for people to play, and help
                people learn to make some themselves.
            </p>
            <h2>What do we do?</h2>
            <p>
                We make games for people to play, and open-source them so people
                can learn from them. We are doing this to thank the game
                industry, and to learn and help others learn programming.
